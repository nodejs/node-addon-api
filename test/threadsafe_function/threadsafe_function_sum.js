/**
 *
 * ThreadSafeFunction Tests: Thread Id Sums
 *
 * Every native C++ function that utilizes the TSFN will call the registered
 * callback with the thread id. Passing Array.prototype.push with a bound array
 * will push the thread id to the array. Therefore, starting `N` threads, we
 * will expect the sum of all elements in the array to be `(N-1) * (N) / 2` (as
 * thread IDs are 0-based)
 *
 * We check different methods of passing a ThreadSafeFunction around multiple
 * threads:
 *  - `testWithTSFN`: The main thread creates the TSFN. Then, it creates
 *    threads, passing the TSFN at thread construction. The number of threads is
 *    static (known at TSFN creation).
 *  - `testDelayedTSFN`: The main thread creates threads, passing a promise to a
 *    TSFN at construction. Then, it creates the TSFN, and resolves each
 *    threads' promise. The number of threads is static.
 *  - `testAcquire`: The native binding returns a function to start a new. A
 *    call to this function will return `false` once `N` calls have been made.
 *    Each thread will acquire its own use of the TSFN, call it, and then
 *    release.
